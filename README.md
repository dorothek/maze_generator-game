# maze_generator-game
The program is the maze generator in Python. It uses randomized version of the depth-first search algorithm. 
The game allows for three game modes: human with AI (AI is able to find a way out of the maze by himself using recursive backtracking), human alone, the option in which AI leaves the maze on its own.
